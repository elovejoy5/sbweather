    <h1>About `sbweather`</h1>
    <p>
      `sbweather` is a prototype react app. I need a bit of code to hack on,
      share, and write about while I'm job hunting in November 2022 for the
      first time since 2001.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since I'm often curious about the weather here, maybe I'll keep at it and
      it will become more than a code sample.
